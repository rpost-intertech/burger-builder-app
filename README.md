## Project Description
This basic React application allows a user to dynamically build a burger, add ingredients, and order preview for ordering the burger. The application includes a toolbar (and a sidebar for mobile use), a dynamic,visual preview of the burger being built, a list of ingredients that can be added to/removed from the burger with the ability to add/remove items to the burger being built. It also displays a order summary after the 'Submit Order' button has been clicked.

## Final Note

This application was created by Rita Post to serve the purpose of understanding the basic fundamentals of React. Given the limited exposure to React at the time of this app's creation, Rita was unable to provide Testing, React Hooks, or error handling and data validation in this application. If time permits, these features will be added to this app at a future date.
